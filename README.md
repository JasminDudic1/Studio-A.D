A temple project of a node library for a scheduler that I have edited for my own purposes.
I added a largy amount of utilities that I needed, fixed a few bugs that I found and managed to connect it to a database to save data rather than local storage it used.
Currently I managed to deploy it on a local machine and to connect from a couple devices, but did not manage to deploy it on heroku ass I use the free tier and it takes too much space.
Only supports saving data to database, to add updating and deleting just change from local storage to database.
